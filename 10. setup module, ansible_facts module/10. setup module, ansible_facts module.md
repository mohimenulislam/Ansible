In Ansible, both the setup and gather_facts modules are related to collecting information about t
lhe target hosts, but they have different use cases and are invoked differently. Here's the distin
ction between the two:

### 1.setup Module: 
Purpose:
Used to gather detailed information (facts) about the remote system, such as:
- Hardware information
- OS details
- Network interfaces
- More system-level data


```
ansible-doc setup
ansible servera -m setup
ansible servera -m setup >> setup.txt
ansible servera -m setup -a "filter=ansible_user_id"
```

Starts with `ansible` is fact variable

#### by defaults gather_facts=yes 
```
---
- name: Fact variable
  hosts: servera
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
   - name: Collecting only ansible_fqdn values
     setup:
      filter: ansible_fqdn

   - name: Check Fact Variable
     debug:
      msg: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
```

```
---
- name: Fact variable
  hosts: servera
  tasks:
   - name: Collecting only ansible_fqdn values
     setup:
      filter: ansible_fqdn

   - name: Check Fact Variable
     debug:
      msg: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
```



### 2. gather_facts

Purpose: gather_facts is a playbook-level setting that controls whether facts should be automatic
lally gathered at the beginning of a playbook execution. By default, Ansible gathers facts before
runnina anv tasks in a plavbook.


```
ansible servera -m gather_facts
ansible servera -m gather_facts >> gather.txt
vimdiff setup.txt gather.txt # yum install vim 
```

##### Check  remote machine fqdn  
```
---
- name: Fact variable 
  hosts: servera
  tasks:
   - name: Check Fact Variable
     debug:
      msg: "{{ ansible_fqn }}"
```
```
ansible-playbook fact
```

#### By defaults gather_facts=yes; Lets try with gather_facts=yes 

```
---
- name: Fact variable
  hosts: servera
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
   - name: Check Fact Variable
     debug:
      msg: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
```
```
ansible-playbook fact
```
