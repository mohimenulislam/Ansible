In Ansible, both the setup and gather_facts modules are related to collecting information about t
lhe target hosts, but they have different use cases and are invoked differently. Here's the distin
ction between the two:

### 1.setup Module: 
Purpose:
Used to gather detailed information (facts) about the remote system, such as:
- Hardware information
- OS details
- Network interfaces
- More system-level data

### 2. gather_facts

Purpose: gather_facts is a playbook-level setting that controls whether facts should be automatic
lally gathered at the beginning of a playbook execution. By default, Ansible gathers facts before
runnina anv tasks in a plavbook.
